==
1.4: Write a method to replace all spaces 
in a string with '%20'. 
You may assume that the string 
has sufficient space at the end 
of the string to hold the additional 
characters, and that you are given the 
"true" length of the string. 
(Note: if implementing in Java, 
please usea character array so that 
you can perform this operation inplace.)
