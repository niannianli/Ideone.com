you cannot use additional data structures?

==
1.4: Write a method to replace all spaces 
in a string with '%20'. 
You may assume that the string 
has sufficient space at the end 
of the string to hold the additional 
characters, and that you are given the 
"true" length of the string. 
(Note: if implementing in Java, 
please usea character array so that 
you can perform this operation inplace.)

==
1.5: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string a a b c c c c c a a a would become a2blc5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
